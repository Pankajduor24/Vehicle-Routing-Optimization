# Vehicle-Routing-Optimization

Vehicle routing is such a beautiful and challenging problem that almost every organization deals with it.
In vehicle routing problem we try to find the feasibility for our problem first then we talk about optimality. But 
due to very high complexity of this problem it is very costly to solve using the exact methods, so what we do is,
we use heuristics or metaheuristics to solve such problems.
